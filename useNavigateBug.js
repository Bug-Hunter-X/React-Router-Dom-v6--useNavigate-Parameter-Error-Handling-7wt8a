In React Router Dom v6, navigating to a route with a parameter using the `useNavigate` hook might throw an error if the parameter is not provided or is of the incorrect type.  For example, if your route is defined as `/users/:id`, and you try to navigate to `/users` without an id, it will cause issues. This can happen when a component tries to navigate with incomplete data or data that hasn't yet been fetched.
